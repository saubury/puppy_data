# Puppy Data
🐾 Puppy Data 🐾 combines a love of data and dogs — a project to track Barney the puppy🐶! Using load-cells and low power motion tracking sensors I built an automated system to monitor Barney’s weight, sleep habits, and activity📊. Data is sent to Home Assistant for easy tracking via a slick interface 📱. CotexAI and a Streamlit application allows me to ask questions like _“How much heavier is Barney this month?”_ or _“When was he most active?”_   🐕💡. 

A blend of IoT, DIY tech, and puppy love ❤️📈!
